The business event module is responsible for managing channels for the events. All channel is defined with an operation mode and supported with execution service to execute the events. The event is a piece of code to execute. Tpically it could be a function to call or we can have a specific function that manages all the events from a channel. The channel is persisted into the database so we can ensure that every event will be processed one and only one time.<br>The channels can be stopped and started dynamically without restarting the application itself.</body>
